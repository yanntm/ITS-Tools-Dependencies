This page hosts content regularly rebuilt using the continuous integration service Travis.
This page hosts these dependencies for ITS-Tools : 
<ul>
<li>Spot (see <a href="https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/">Spot homepage</a>)</li>
<li>LTSmin (see <a href="http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/ltsmin/">LTSmin homepage</a>)</li>
</ul>
These artifacts are not necessarily very portable, they're used in our build system and are specific to a docker hosted on travis-ci.
</p>
<p>
Both of these software are free open source packages. 
Please see the sources of this project to see exactly how we build them on Travis and AppVeyor.
